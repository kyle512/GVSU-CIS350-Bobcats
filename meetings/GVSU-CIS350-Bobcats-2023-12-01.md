Date: 12/01/2023

Time: 12:30 - 1:00 p.m.

Discussion points: 

* What we need to finish over the weekend 

    We need to finish the notes for rock and roll all night to ensure that we can clean that song up and polish it before presenting. Want to also finish scoring and hopefully be close to finishing the animation. Finishing these will put us on track to finish everything before we present.

* Deliverables for the presentation

    Looked at what requirements we had to meet to turn in the project as well as what we needed to have for the presentation and how we were going to present. Decided we could just add off our midterm requirements for srs and had plenty of requirements. Need to have all features working for the presentation as well as export the godot project to have it ready to be playable.

* Decide final tasks to work on

    The final tasks we want to have finished before we present are the entire rock and roll all night with notes, including a scoring feature and an animation for hit notes. We also hope to have an end screen at the end of the song as well as possible having sound for missed notes.
