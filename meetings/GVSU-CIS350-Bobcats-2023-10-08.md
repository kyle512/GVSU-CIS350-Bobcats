Discussion points: 

* Using Godot

    Discussed using Godot instead of pygame to create a better looking game. Looked into setting up different scenes and how we 
    could possibly format the game in Godot.

* Splitting up hw3

    Made a game plan for hw3 and how we can split up the group part of the homework. Everyone is going to do their individual section
    then we can come together to make the srs based off our individual sections. Then We will split up the use case diagrams and use case description among us. 

* Midterm presentation

    Talked about what we wanted to have done for the presentation and what we could showcase for our progress. Talked about what we could use
    to create diagrams. 

Goals for next week
