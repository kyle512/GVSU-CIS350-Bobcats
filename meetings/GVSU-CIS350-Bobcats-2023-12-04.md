Discussion points: 

* What we want done before the presentation

    At this point our game is very close to being finished but we would like to have a couple of additional features ready to go for out presentation. This includes an animation for correct notes, a screen for when you lose and finish the song, a controls menu, and an updated scoring system with the ability to lose after enough missed notes and a multiplyer for hitting notes in a row.

* Talked about specific problems we were having 

    James was having problem with the animation of hitting or missing notes, the animation would get stuck on the note and not go away whihc we talked about possibly ways to solve this. Kyle was struggling with the timing of the notes and we talked about certain parts of the song where the notes seemed off and could be lined up better.

* Talked about what we should talk about during presentation

    We decided that we wanted to cover some of the updates to our planned features of the game and how we had to scale some ideas back but how we also added some additional unplanned features. We also want to talk about some of the key challenges we faced while working on this project as well as show our midterm demo to show the progress we have made since the midterm.
