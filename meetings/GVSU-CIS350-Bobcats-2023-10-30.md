## Team Meeting 10/30/23

Team name: Bobcats

Members present: Parker, Jack, Kyle

Date: 10/30/2023

Time: 3-3:30 p.m.

Discussion points: 

* Implementation to show for homework

    Discussed what tasks we could work on to show implemented for homework. Decided that the two tasks we would focus on were the button functions at the bottom of the fret board and having in-game music. We also discussed the start of animating notes and creating a more visually appealing game.

* How to go about different tasks

    We decided that for the buttons we would make two different textures for when the button is pressed and not pressed so the user can see that they are pressing the buttons. For the music we decided we wanted a preview to play when hovering over the song selection and to get the full songs uploaded for when we are ready to put it in the game. We also wanted to add background music for the main menu.

* Assign roles

    We decided Jack would work on the music portion which consists of uploading the music and making scripts to have the music play at the right times. James and Kyle are responsible for working on the animation when the buttons are pressed to switch between the unpressed and pressed textures. Parker is going to start working on the note animations as well as contribute to the work on the buttons.
