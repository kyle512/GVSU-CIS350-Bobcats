## Team Meeting 11/05/23

Team name: Bobcats

Members present: Parker, Jack, Kyle

Date: 11/05/2023

Time: 2-2:30 p.m.

Discussion points: 

* Discuss what tasks need to be worked on

    Decided that we should create an animation for when a user correctly hits the note so they know whethe they hit or missed a note. Decided that there should be sound when a button is pressed as well as when the user strums for a note and misses it. We also need to work on creating the notes to go down the screen that is synchronized with the song. Finally there needs to be polishing on the previous game implementation.

* Assign roles within group

    Parker is going to work on polishing his previous work with the game implementation animating the notes and checking for note accuracy. Jack is going to continue working with soudns and adding in the sounds we talked about. James is going to work on the animation for when a note is accruactely hit by the user. Kyle is going to work on synchronizing the notes down the screen with the song. 

* Review work done in the previous week

    We also all looked at the work that was done in the previous week and ensured that everyone was aware of how the code worked and was capable of adding to it. This was done be doing a demo of the game and explaining the additions that were made. 

Goals for next week //

* Have work done on the implementations we talked about

* Have ideas brainstormed for ways to polish the game
