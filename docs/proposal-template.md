# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

# Anticipated Technologies

In preperation for starting our project, we have determined some technologies that we are anticipating needing.

* Python
* PyGame
* A Python library for playing music
* A way to import graphics and implement them in the game
* A graphical user interface (GUI)

# Method/Approach

We have layed out a plan for developing this project that involves going about the game in broken down steps.

### Create a the pygame window

*  We want to start by creating a window that displays the 5 notes that will be used in each song

### Take keyboard input

* Next we want to be able to link the 5 notes on the screen with keyboard input from 5 keys. 

### Load in music 

* Next we want to load the music in and play the music timed with the opening of the window.

### Load notes in coorelation with song

* Next we will need to create the individual notes that go along with the song and scroll down the screen.

### Check if the user input matches the song notes

* Next we will need to check if the user keyboard input is matching up with the notes going down the screen with the song.

### Manage score

* Finally we will need to track the score of the user by tracking notes missed and notes hit.

### If we have time

* At the end if we have extra time we would like to incorporate things like difficulty settings, better graphics, a larger library of songs, and possibly syncing a guitar hero guitar to use with the game.

# Estimated Timeline

* Study and practice with pyGame (2 weeks, mid October)
* Create GUI with notes that scroll across the screen, key inputs for hitting notes, score tracker, song selection, etc. (3-4 weeks, end of October)
* Upload music and sync with the notes on screen (2 weeks, mid-November)
* Debugging and finish testing (2 weeks, end of November)
* Presentation (December)

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
* We are not very proficient with pyGame, this will take some studying/practice to get the hang of creating a working GUI with appropriate key inputs
* Syncing music with the notes on the screen requires precise timing to get the result we want. Anticipating a lot of trial and error
